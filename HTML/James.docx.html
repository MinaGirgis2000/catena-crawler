In the early church it was customary to assume that New Testament books had been written by apostles or under the close supervision of an apostle, and two of the original twelve were called James. One of these was the brother of John and son of Zebedee, and the other was the son of Alphaeus. The first of these was the associate of Peter and John and became the first head of the church at Jerusalem, where he was martyred about a.d. 44. The second disappeared from view after the resurrection of Jesus. Some of the Fathers assumed that one of these two wrote this letter, though they were not sure which one. Most Fathers, though, concluded that it was another James, the one who appears in the New Testament among the brothers of Jesus. This James was head of the Jerusalem church from a.d. 44 to 62 and is a much more plausible candidate for authorship than either of the others. The assumption then was that this James, whose authority derived from his close kinship with Jesus, was writing from the Jewish capital to those Jews who had left Palestine and were scattered across the Roman world. The fact that he refers to himself as a &ldquo;servant&rdquo; was regarded as a sign of his humility and as standing in sharp contrast to the usual letter-writing practice of the time. Today the authenticity of James is still questioned, but most scholars recognize that it must be one of the earliest New Testament writings. The authorship of James the brother of Jesus continues to find its defenders and must be regarded as plausible, even if it cannot be proved now any more than it could be in patristic times. To be a slave of Christ is, for the apostles, greater than having command of all the kingdoms of the world (Didymus, Oecumenius). This is a voluntary servanthood (Hilary of Arles). James wrote this letter to those suffering persecution (Bede).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">1:1 </span><span class="c1 c3">The Identity of James</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Martyrdom of James.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Josephus: Caesar sent Albinus to Judea as procurator when he was informed of the death of Festus. But the younger Annas, who as I said had received the high priesthood, was headstrong in character and audacious in the extreme. He belonged to the sect of the Sadducees, who in judging offenders are cruel beyond any of the Jews, as I have already made clear. Being a man of this kind, Annas thought that he had a convenient opportunity, as Festus was dead and Albinus still on the way. So he assembled a council of judges and brought it before James, the brother of Jesus, known as Christ, and several others. Annas charged them with breaking the law and handed them over to be stoned. But those who were considered the most fair-minded people in the city, and strict in their observance of the law, were most indignant at this, and sent secretly to the king, imploring him to write to Annas to stop behaving in this way. His conduct had been wrong from the first. Some of them too waylaid Albinus on the road from Alexandria and explained that it was illegal for Annas to assemble a council without his authority. Convinced by their arguments, Albinus wrote an angry letter to Annas, threatening to punish him. In consequence, King Agrippa deprived him of the high priesthood, which he had held for three months only, and appointed Jeshua son of Dammaeus.

The involuntary servant is a slave who fears punishment, and therefore his service does not spring from love. But the voluntary servant is really no different from a son. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of James.</span><span class="c0 c4">4</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To the Persecuted.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: We read that when Stephen was martyred a great persecution of the church broke out at Jerusalem and that they were all scattered across the countryside of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles. James then wrote this letter to those who had been scattered because they had suffered persecution for the sake of righteousness. And not only to them, but also, as the rest of the letter testifies, to those who had become Christians but who were still struggling to achieve perfection, as well as to those who remained outside the faith themselves and did their best to persecute and disturb believers. All of these people were exiles, though for different reasons. But we also read in the Acts of the Apostles that at the time of our Lord's death there were devout Jews &ldquo;from every nation under heaven.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">5</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;What these nations were is explained a little further on, where Luke mentions Parthians, Medes, Elamites, inhabitants of Mesopotamia, and so on.</span><span class="c0 c4">6</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;James also exhorts the righteous not to lose their faith, and he rebukes sinners, warning them that they must refrain from sinning and practice virtue, so that they would not be condemned by those who had received the sacraments of faith in an unfruitful way, even worthy of hell. He goes now to warn unbelievers to repent of the murder of the Savior and of the other crimes in which they were implicated before divine retribution overtook them secretly, or even openly for that matter. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">7</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Slaves of Christ.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: More than any worldly dignity, the Lord's apostles gloried in the fact that they were slaves of Christ. That is how they wanted to be known in their preaching, in their writing and in their teaching. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">8</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To the Twelve Tribes in Dispersion.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Isho'dad of Merv: The opening resembles the titles of St. Paul's letters, and perhaps James is the author of it, whoever he may be. He was unacquainted with Paul's custom of writing to one particular nation and city, and for a particular reason. Instead, this author writes to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations because of the captivity, and not to the churches in every place, because he had no particular reason to be so specific. Commentaries, Prologue.</span><span class="c0 c4">9</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">1:2&ndash;15 TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;James was writing to people who were suffering from temptations of various kinds, though there is no sign that a general persecution of Christians had as yet broken out. The Greek word </span><span class="c0 c3">peirasmos</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;can be translated either as &ldquo;trial&rdquo; or as &ldquo;temptation,&rdquo; and the second of these possibilities dominated the Fathers' interpretation of these verses. To them the cure for temptation was patient endurance, which was the fruit of a spiritual wisdom that could be obtained only from God. There was no problem with obtaining this, as long as believers asked God for wisdom in faith, without doubting that they would receive it. Doubt and riches appear as the greatest enemies of true faith because in their different ways, they both contributed to human pride and arrogance. Once those vices took control, it was impossible to wage war against temptation, because temptation was also the fruit of human lusts and therefore a close ally of pride. It was essential therefore to overcome this basic human weakness, since failure to do so would lead inevitably to spiritual death.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Prepare for many temptations (Chryosostom, Hilary of Arles). They will be like a raging torrent that only a strong swimmer can negotiate (Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine). The joy of faith is proved through endurance (Oecumenius, Symeon). No one can take away this joy (Bede). We are tempted by adversities in order to learn the virtue of patience (Bede) and faith (Hilary of Arles). We are not to be discouraged by these trials (Andreas). The purity of faith is made perfect by patient endurance of affliction (Bede, Andreas, Oecumenius), which casts out fear (Hilary of Arles).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We pray that the faith that justifies may increase in those who already have it and also that it may be given to those who have not yet received it (Augustine). We must ask God for the spiritual wisdom to face temptations (Bede, Oecumenius, Theophylact), a wisdom that only God can give (Augustine, Hilary of Arles, Bede). One who does not ask in faith is not heard (Hilary of Arles, Bede). The root of doubt is pride (Cyril of Alexandria), which easily turns into despair (Oecumenius). Ask without hesitation without being double-minded (Bede, Oecumenius). Do not worry inordinately about your guilt, but count on God's mercy (Hermas). A double-minded person is one who prays to God yet fails to obtain anything because one's conscience is still accusing all the time (Bede). Such a person is unstable (Origen), like waves on the sea (Oecumenius). Meanwhile every good thing comes to the humble (Hilary of Arles, Oecumenius, Theophylact).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Only those who endure adversity are rewarded (Bede). What puffs up the rich is what brings them down (Oecumenius). Their wealth is vulnerable (Hilary of Arles, Bede, Oecumenius). The heavier the endured sufferings of the righteous, the more courageous are their victories (Sulpicius Severus). A crown awaits them (Chrysostom, Bede). James encourages the hope that the present situation will be put aright (Didymus). Any testing that comes from God is for good, not for evil. Not so with the devil, who tempts in order to kill and who does not know us as God knows (Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine, Bede, Andreas). God may abandon us at times to reveal our own stubborn willing (Peter Chrysologus). To find a remedy our very nature must be healed (Augustine). Lust does not give birth unless it conceives, and it does not conceive unless it receives willing consent to commit evil (Augustine). Until we labor and give birth to our corrupt thoughts, we seem happy and joyful, but once the wicked child called sin is born we are in pain as we realize the shame to which we ourselves have given birth (Chrysostom). Lust coaxes and urges on, positively encouraging us to do something bad. If we ponder it willingly, then it will conceive and give birth (Augustine, Hesychius). Suggestion, experiment and consent are the three stages of temptation (Bede, Hilary).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">1:2 </span><span class="c1 c3">Finding Joy in Suffering</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Count It Joy.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Origen: If you count it all joy when you fall into various temptations, you give birth to joy, and you offer that joy in sacrifice to God. Sermons on Genesis 8.10.</span><span class="c0 c4">1</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Torrent of the Trial.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Cyril of Jerusalem: &ldquo;Falling into temptation&rdquo; may mean being overwhelmed by temptation, for temptation is like a raging torrent which engulfs the traveler. In times of temptation some people manage to cross this torrent without being overwhelmed by the rising tide, because they are good swimmers who can avoid being swept away. But if others who lack their strength try to do it, they are overcome. Mystagogical Lectures 5.17.</span><span class="c0 c4">2</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Prepare for Temptation.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Chrysostom: Suffering is a real bond, an encouragement to greater love, and the basis of spiritual perfection and godliness. Listen to the one who says: &ldquo;If you want to serve the Lord, prepare your soul for temptation.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And again Christ said: &ldquo;In the world you will have tribulation, but take courage.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And again: &ldquo;straight and narrow is the way.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">5</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Everywhere you see suffering being praised, everywhere it is accepted as necessary for us. For in the world there is no one who wins a trophy without suffering, who has not strengthened himself with labors and dieting and exercise and vigils and many other things like that.

For as Paul said: &ldquo;Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">8</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Temptations come in three ways, by persuasion, by attraction and by consent.

Moreover, they thought it perfect joy when they encountered different kinds of temptations.

On the Gift of Perseverance 44.</span><span class="c0 c4">26</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Only God Gives Wisdom.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hilary of Arles: Why does James tell them to seek wisdom?</span><span class="c0 c4">27</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It is so that they might have God's assurance. Only God should be asked for wisdom, not philosophers or astrologers. God gives wisdom like a fountain which never runs out of water, and he fills everyone whom he enters, but the wisdom of philosophers and other human agents is not given in abundance, and it is soon spewed out. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of James.</span><span class="c0 c4">28</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wisdom to Face Temptation.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Saving wisdom can come only from God and cannot be found by human free will, without the help of divine grace, as the Pelagians insist. Here, however, James is speaking particularly about that wisdom which we need when we meet temptations. He says that if there are some among us who do not understand why it is that we need to be tested in this way, then we should ask God to explain to us that a father must punish his children in order to make them ready for the inheritance of eternal life. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">29</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ask God for Wisdom.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: James calls wisdom the cause of perfection. He knows that faith is tried and tested in affliction. There is no need to ask God for perfect people. What we need are wise people.

Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">30</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Spiritual Wisdom.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Theophylact: James is referring here to spiritual wisdom, not the human kind.

For if you have not believed that God will hear your request, you have not acted in such a way as to avoid being condemned already by the one who tests everything.

As Scripture says: &ldquo;If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">34</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">35</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pride Turns to Despair.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: If a person is confident, let him ask. But if he doubts he should not ask, because he will not receive what he is not sure about. Such a person soon retreats from the faith which he does have and then backslides. This happens to him because of his pride, because he quickly despairs of ever getting something which he asks for if it does not turn up immediately.

The rising sun stands for the sentence of the strict Judge, which puts a quick end to the transient glory of the reprobate.

He nevertheless tries to persuade his hearers to rely on the promise that their present state will be put right. The person who has fought the hard battles will be perfectly able to handle anything.

But when it gives birth and reaches its goal, then all the pleasure is extinguished and the bitter core of our mind comes to the surface. This stands in contrast to women in labor. For before they give birth, such women have great pain and suffering, but afterwards the pain goes away, leaving their bodies along with the child. But here it is quite different. For until we labor and give birth to our corrupt thoughts, we are happy and joyful. But once the wicked child called sin is born we are in pain as we realize the shame to which we have given birth, and then we are pierced through more deeply than any woman in labor. Therefore I beg you right from the start not to welcome any corrupt thought, for if we do so the seeds will grow inside us, and if we get to that stage, the sin inside us will come out in deeds and strike us dead by condemning us, in spite of all our confessions and tears. For there is nothing more destructive than sin.

But if we let the enemy's suggestions gradually take control of us, then we find that we are taken away from the right path and start to indulge in sin. However, if we go no further than initial experiments, we may have offended God, but we have not yet fallen into mortal sin. However, if we continue down the path of depravity and start to embrace evildoing by giving our full consent to it, then we are deserving of death, and the enemy has triumphed over us.

Every spiritual gift comes from God and reflects his character as the Father of lights. Every good endowment is an undeserved, a free gift of God for which we pray every day (Augustine). What God gives is without defect (Didymus). The soul is progressively enlightened in its ascent after the resurrection (Origen), cleansed from wickedness (Oecumenius). The procession of Light spreads itself generously toward us in a unitive way (Pseudo-Dionysius). Nothing can add or subtract from God's glory (Novatian), who is unchanging in his divine essence (Severus). No shadow can cut off God's light (Gregory the Great). Anyone who stands in this light wishes to share it with others (Symeon). We must, however, distinguish our begottenness as children of light from the eternal begottenness of the Son (Andreas, Bede, Oecumenius).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, those who possess God's Spirit will be self-controlled in their behavior and will avoid every form of wickedness. Above all, truly spiritual persons will do their utmost to put their faith into practice, since that is the ultimate test of what it means to be born again in Christ. The truth heard is less prone to corruption than the truth spoken (Augustine). The tongue must be disciplined (Bede). To be quick to hear implies eagerness to put into practice what has been heard (Oecumenius). Two things in particular are indicative of spiritual maturity: the ability to hold one's tongue and a willingness to be generous toward those who are in need. A charitable disposition and charitable behavior must go hand in hand in the life of someone who wants to imitate God's perfect charity. Widows and orphans are especially to be looked after (Hermas, Hilary of Arles). We become more like God in showing acts of mercy (Chrysostom). Illusions about one's own correctness arise out of the lack of self-control (Gregory the Great, Oecumenius). Imitate God's justice, which is without anger (Bede). Avoid uncontrollable fury, which leads to a habituation to wickedness (Andreas, Bede, Oecumenius). One single uniting Word is addressed to us through many scriptures (Augustine). We are called to enact in behavior what we hear (Augustine, Oecumenius). We best view our deeper selves in the mirror of the gospel (Hilary of Arles). Yet if we behold ourselves in this mirror and then forget it or fail to confirm it in deeds, what we have learned will slip out of our hands (Andreas, Oecumenius). The doer of the Word delights in the perfect law that liberates from sin and death (Augustine, Oecumenius).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">1:16 </span><span class="c1 c3">Do Not Be Deceived</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Deception.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hilary of Arles: This refers to the deception of the heretics who think that because God rules the physical world in darkness and in light, in drought and in rain, in cold and in heat, so he also rules over human wills with the same determinateness&mdash;in good and in bad, in sadness and in joy, in death and in life. Because of this error, James goes on to add that it is &ldquo;every good endowment and every perfect gift&rdquo; which comes from the Father of lights.

These gifts, James says, are the very best, complete and without defect, undoubtedly perfect. But as there are some people who argue from this that only the good things in life come from God, and not things which are regarded as bad or harmful, we have to recall such passages as &ldquo;he brought evil on them,&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Evil came down from God onto the gates of Jerusalem&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and so on.

For the modification implied in change from one thing to another involves a share in death of some sort. Therefore there is never any addition of parts or of glory in him, lest anything should seem to have been wanting to the perfect one in the first place.

Therefore Paul also warned people, saying: &ldquo;Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may prove what the good and acceptable and perfect will of God is.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">15</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">16</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">God's Light.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Gregory the Great: This changing is a shadow which conceals the divine light if it goes through certain ups and downs in this life, but because God is unchanging, no shadow can cut off his light.

For to him belong truth and consubstantiality with God, whereas to the creatures belong honor and inheritance. The fact that the same name is used does not mean that the same honor is given, nor should things which are said by extension be taken to mean that they apply in the first instance as well. By &ldquo;first fruits&rdquo; James means that we are the first and most highly honored. For by &ldquo;creatures&rdquo; he means the visible creation, of which humanity is the most highly honored part.

But lest we should think that by &ldquo;begetting&rdquo; us in this way God has made us somehow a part of his own nature, James goes on to add that the result of the divine activity is that we have become &ldquo;the first fruits of his creatures,&rdquo; which means that we have been exalted over the rest of creation. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">22</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our Begottenness Distinguished from That of the Son.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: Here James reminds us that God is immutable, which is not true of us. For if we have been born it is clear that we have also been changed. How can something be immutable if it has gone from nonbeing to being? Furthermore he adds that God has given us birth by the Word of Life, lest we might be tempted to think that his Son was also born in the same way as we are. But according to John, all things were made by the Son, which means that he was not born along with us who have been made by him.

Someone who wants to become wise must first of all ask for this gift from God, as James has already said. Then he must find himself a good teacher and in the meantime discipline his tongue so that he says nothing useless but restricts himself to preaching the truth which he has recently learned from others.

For he distinguishes quite clearly between the person who is ready to act on what he has heard and the one who is weighed down by laziness and procrastination, sometimes even to the point of never attempting to do anything at all.

This is where those who are slow come into their own. It may be wrong to be slow in other things, but when it comes to anger, tardiness is the right policy, because by the time we get round to it the reasons for it may have dissipated.

Why does he not rebuke them and turn them away from it? To this we answer that James accommodates himself to them and starts where they are. Rather than attack the law head on, he draws them away from it gradually, aware that they are suspicious of new ideas and inclined toward skepticism about them. By doing this he increasingly prepares them to hear what he has to say and then weans them away from observance of the law little by little.

It is clear that for James some of the most intractable problems on this score were influenced by economic factors. Rich people in the church were expecting and receiving special considerations from their wealth. This was an insidious attack on the gospel, which especially honored one who was poor in worldly goods but rich in spiritual things. To show contempt for the poor is as much an infraction of the law as murder or adultery, and it is even more serious because it is so common. Christians must learn to fight against the temptations of worldly wealth and concentrate instead on the heavenly blessings, which are the only true riches. Both rich and poor are all of one body in Christ (Chrysostom). Ostentation and favoritism are reproached (Augustine, Hilary of Arles, Oecumenius). God chooses the weak to shame the strong (Augustine). The nobility are not immune from criticism (Salvian). The displaced poor are comforted by God (Hilary of Arles), and their energies are especially used of God (Oecumenius). Those who base their lives on greed are the poorest of all (Chrysostom). Loving the neighbor has a literal reference to those immediately present, a spiritual reference to those absent, and a contemplative reference to love itself (Hilary of Arles). Treat the neighbor as you would one most dear (Andreas). To have fallen from the precept of love is thereby to have offended in all the other commandments (Caesarius of Arles, Augustine, Andreas). God's righteousness is like a covering over the whole body, hiding all offenses (Gregory the Great). Adultery and murder are mentioned as extreme examples of offenses against love (Hilary of Arles, Oecumenius). There can be no favoritism in the law of liberty under which we are to be prepared to be judged (Oecumenius). Mercy breaks chains, dispels darkness, extinguishes fire, kills the worm and takes away the gnashing of teeth (Chrysostom). It is an oil of escape from the demonic (Hesychius). The mercy that one does not show to others will not be shown to him (Augustine, Braulio of Saragossa). We ask God to forgive us as we forgive others, but if we do not forgive, we shall not be forgiven (Oecumenius).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">2:1 </span><span class="c1 c3">Impartiality</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All of One Body.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Chrysostom: What does it matter if you think highly of yourself, when someone else despises you? Are we not all one body, both great and small? Therefore if in principle we are all one and members of each other, why do you mindlessly exalt yourself? Why do you bring shame on your brother? For just as he is a part of you, so you too are a part of him. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">1</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Holding the Faith.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: James here demonstrates that those to whom he is writing were full of faith but empty when it came to works. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">2</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Favoritism.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: Anyone who does things by showing favoritism covers himself with great shame and reproach, for that way he brings disdain not only on his neighbor but much more on himself as well.

You have chosen the weak things of this world to put the strong to shame, and you have chosen things which are dishonorable, despised and of no account, in order to bring to nothing the things which are.

Do the nobility think that they are immune from his strictures, because he referred only to the rich and not to the noble as well? But there is so great an overlap between these two groups in practice that it makes little difference which one of them the apostle was speaking about. His words certainly apply to both.

Those people destroy themselves, not you. For while they rob you of your money, they strip themselves of God's favor and help. For the one who bases his life on greed and gathers all the wealth of the world around him is in fact the poorest of all. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">13</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Using Power to Oppress.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Here James shows us more clearly who these rich people are, whose humiliation and destruction he talked about earlier. They are people who put their riches before Christ, who are themselves strangers to his teaching and who use their power to oppress those who believe. They take poor people to court and blaspheme the name of Christ. That there were many upper-class people in the time of the apostles who did this kind of thing is clear both from the Acts of the Apostles and from Paul's letters.

The first is corporal, that is, the literal sense of the words. The second is spiritual, according to which we love those close to us even though we may be absent from them. The third is contemplative, by which love itself is beheld. But we have to understand that one leads to another. The corporal inspires us to go on to the spiritual, and that in turn lifts us up to the contemplative. The spiritual may sometimes regress to the merely corporal, but the contemplative never fails us. The corporal and spiritual forms of love are common to human beings and have analogies in animals, but the contemplative is reserved for humans alone.

Righteousness is like this, for it protects itself by good works at every turn and leaves nothing exposed to the ravages of sin. For if someone is righteous in some of the things he does and unrighteous in others, it is rather as if he is covering one side of his body but leaving the other side naked. Such a person is not doing good works, because these works are made evil by the unrighteousness which is present in him.

If something in the head is not right, the rest of the body suffers as a result. The entire purpose and plan of God is designed to lead to perfect love. That is the meaning of the commandments such as &ldquo;Do not commit adultery,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not kill&rdquo; and so on.

Pious talk without equally serious deeds is not only useless but also wicked. Faith is shown through one's deeds (Andreas). Those who practice evil but think they have faith are confused (Augustine). Words alone do not help the hungry (Bede). Love cares about the body as well as the soul (Hilary of Arles, Valerian of Cimiez). Opportunities to care for the poor may pass quickly (Caesarius of Arles). Clemency will be exalted above condemnation for those who are merciful (Leo). Lacking works, faith is dead (Origen, Augustine, Leo). Works give life to faith (Hilary of Arles). They have faith who are willing to follow Christ in his suffering (Symeon). Words alone do not save (Chrysostom). Faith shows through deeds (Symeon). The devils in a sense believe that God exists (Bede) with trembling and wordy confessions that Christ is Son of God (Andreas, Caesarius) but not with active love (Augustine). Worse than the devils are those who presume to have faith but do not even tremble (Hilary of Arles). No one receives the gift of justification on the basis of merit derived from works performed beforehand (Bede). Active faith shines forth through works (Cyril of Alexandria, Salvian). It is foolish to presume to believe without acting (Oecumenius).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Fathers were well aware that Paul had spoken of salvation by faith without the works of the law, but they saw no contradiction between that and what James is saying here. The reason for this is that James and Paul are speaking in complementary ways. It is impossible to earn salvation by doing things to please God, and everyone must be clear that we can be saved only by faith. Both belief and action are intrinsic to faith (Augustine, Bede, Oecumenius). Both Paul and James knew that Abraham was perfect in his faith as well as in his works (Bede). James is talking here about faith after baptism, for a faith without works can only make us more guilty of sin, seeing that we have received a talent but are not using it profitably (Oecumenius). Prebaptismal faith does not of itself require works but only confession and the word of salvation, by which those who believe in Christ are justified. Postbaptismal faith is conjoined with works (Andreas). Isaac was an earthly type of Christ being offered up for us all (Hilary of Arles). When Abraham bound Isaac to the altar, he did not merely do it as a work that was required of him, but with the faith that in Isaac his seed would be as numberless as the stars of heaven, believing that God could raise him from the dead (Cyril of Alexandria, Oecumenius). It was by Abraham's perfect accomplishment of God's command that the active faith that he had in his heart was shown to be perfect (Bede). His deeds were perfected by his faith (Cyril of Jerusalem). Although orthodox belief is the foundation of our common confession as Christians, it is not good enough merely to mouth the words of a creed or pronounce blessings. Christians must back up what they say with what they do. Otherwise their words will be disregarded and condemned for the hypocrites that they so obviously are.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Abraham gives us a good example, since his faith led him to be willing to sacrifice his son Isaac. Rahab is even more remarkable. As a Gentile and a harlot, she did not have either the right theology or a respectable lifestyle, but God spared her because when the test came, she did the right thing. Rahab was justified by her faith because she performed works of mercy and showed hospitality to God's people (Bede). Faith saves and then lives by doing its own works (Didymus). Christians must therefore be both inspired and warned by these examples; inspired, because we possess so much more knowledge of the truth than either Abraham or Rahab possessed and can therefore do so much more than they did, but also warned, because if we fail to do even as much as they did, we shall be punished all the more severely for having rejected the knowledge that we have been given (Bede).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">2:14 </span><span class="c1 c3">Faith Without Works</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Persistent Evil.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Augustine: In order to help them, God has put fear in the hearts of believers, lest they think that they might be saved by faith alone, even if they continue to practice these evils.

James here expounds how Paul's words ought to be understood. This is why he uses the example of Abraham, whom Paul also used as an example of faith, to show that the patriarch also performed good works in the light of his faith. It is therefore wrong to interpret Paul in such a way as to suggest that it did not matter whether Abraham put his faith into practice or not. What Paul meant was that no one obtains the gift of justification on the basis of merit derived from works performed beforehand, because the gift of justification comes only from faith. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">27</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You Foolish Person!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: According to James, someone who thinks that it is possible to believe without acting accordingly is out of his mind.

What does the fire stand for if not the suffering of Christ? What does the sword signify, if not death? What does the wood indicate, if not the cross? And what is the importance of Abraham's heavy heart, if it does not stand for the compassion of the Father and the angels as they beheld the death of Christ? Isaac was an earthly type of Christ and was offered up for us all. According to tradition this occurred on 25 March, the day on which the world was created, the day on which the last judgment will occur. The place where it happened was none other than the one which God would later choose for the site of his temple on Mount Zion, which is so called because Zion means &ldquo;mirror of life,&rdquo; for it was there that Abraham saw as in a mirror the life which was to be revealed in the New Testament. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of James.</span><span class="c0 c4">29</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Abraham's Believing and Doing.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: James makes deft use of the example of Abraham in order to provoke those Jews who imagined that they were worthy followers of their great ancestor. In order to show them that they did not come up to the mark in times of trial and to test their faith by specific examples, James takes Abraham as his model. For what greater trial could there be than to demand that a man sacrifice his beloved son and heir? How much more would Abraham have preferred to give all the food and clothing he possessed to the poor than to be forced to make this supreme sacrifice at God's command? James is merely echoing what it says in Hebrews: &ldquo;By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son, of whom it was said, &lsquo;Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.'&nbsp;&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">30</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Looking at one and the same sacrifice, James praised the magnificence of Abraham's work, while Paul praised the constancy of his faith. But in reality the two men are saying exactly the same thing, because they both knew that Abraham was perfect in his faith as well as in his works, and each one merely emphasized that aspect of the incident which his own audience was most in need of hearing. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">31</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Distinguishing Pre- and Postbaptismal Faith.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Andreas: Now someone might object to this and say: &ldquo;Did Paul not use Abraham as an example of someone who was justified by faith, without works? And here James is using the very same Abraham as an example of someone who was justified, not by faith alone, but also by works which confirm that faith.&rdquo; How can we answer this? And how can Abraham be an example of faith without works, as well as of faith with works, at the same time? But the solution is ready to hand from the Scriptures. For the same Abraham is at different times an example of both kinds of faith. The first is prebaptismal faith, which does not require works but only confession and the word of salvation, by which those who believe in Christ are justified. The second is postbaptismal faith, which is combined with works. Understood in this way, the two apostles do not contradict one another, but one and the same Spirit is speaking through both of them.

However, this is to be understood as meaning that Abraham believed before he had Isaac and that Isaac was given to him as a reward for his faith. Likewise, when he bound Isaac to the altar, he did not merely do the work which was required of him, but he did it with the faith that in Isaac his seed would be as numberless as the stars of heaven, believing that God could raise him from the dead.</span><span class="c0 c4">33</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">34</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">2:22 </span><span class="c1 c3">Faith Is Completed by Works</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nothing Comparable to God's Love.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Cyril of Alexandria: He has sacrificed the spiritual victim and announced that the laws of nature have been overcome.

This is why his faith was reckoned to him as righteousness, and it was in order that we might know the full meaning of this that God ordered Abraham to sacrifice his son.

Furthermore, it is to be understood that faith without works is not faith at all, just as a dead man is not really a human being. But how can some say that because the spirit which gives life to the body is more honorable than the body, therefore works are more honorable than faith? I have looked into this matter in some detail and shall try to explain my position on this. It is undoubtedly true that the spirit is nobler than the body, but this does not mean that works can be put before faith, because a person is saved by grace, not by works but by faith. There should be no doubt but that faith saves and then lives by doing its own works, so that the works which are added to salvation by faith are not those of the law but a different kind of thing altogether.

The tongue is the most powerful weapon that we have, both for good and for evil. It is a matter for wonder that such a small part of the body can do such great things. It can preach the Word of God, win nations for Christ and glorify the name of our Creator. But it can also destroy character, divide churches and kill the soul. Human beings have learned to tame horses and ships, but their own tongues are another matter. Yet the tongue only reflects what is going on in the heart and soul of the person who is speaking, and it is this fact that is the real danger. For if a person claims to be a believer but then says things that contradict that claim, the truth is that he or she is not a Christian. No one is perfect, and we must be ready to make allowances for the failings of others rather than criticize them. Moreover, teachers will be judged by a higher standard, and therefore they must take special care not to fall into the trap of verbal abuse.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Christ chose only twelve teachers, and some of them did not come through (Hilary of Arles). The deeds of teachers must correspond with their words (Chrysostom, Oecumenius). Some are too eager to teach, so as to lead to false teaching (Isho&lsquo;dad, Bede). James singles out the tongue as a special instrument for either great good or great evil (Didymus, Jerome, Bede). No one is free from sins of the tongue (Augustine, Oecumenius). Yet the saints seek to allay God's judgment on their speech (Severus, Cyril of Alexandria) and pray for the healing of their speech (Pachomius). We may be imperfect, but we can still seek to avoid deception, cursing, pride, boasting, quarreling, lying and perjury (Bede). Sins of the tongue are many (Basil). So put brakes on the mouth (Augustine, Bede). The tongue is like a fire (Hilary of Arles) that can destroy a whole forest of good works just by saying evil things (Bede). The tongue can infect like gangrene (Pachomius, Oecumenius). The metaphor of the horse with bit in mouth (Chrysostom) is complemented by that of the ruddered ship (Andreas, Oecumenius): the great ship of life is blown by strong winds of passion yet directed by a small rudder&mdash;the intention of the heart (Bede). Taming the tongue is harder than taming a wild beast (Augustine, Andreas). Like a sword, the tongue is capable of wounding (Chrysostom, Hesychius). It is not made for cursing (Andreas). If mixed, the bitter water overcomes the sweet water (Bede). Yet the bad tongue can be converted, as in the case of Paul (Andreas).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">3:1a </span><span class="c1 c3">Let Not Many of You Become Teachers</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Christ Chose Only Twelve.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hilary of Arles: The apostle here prohibits a large number of teachers, for even our Lord Jesus Christ chose only a few for this role.

So reject the teaching of those who teach without setting an example and pass judgment on them. Yet if there is no contradiction between what he says and what he does, and he is able to control his entire body, then do not condemn him. For if he teaches such things and surrounds the right words of his faith with outstanding deeds corresponding to it, it is clear that he is fully in charge of his body and has no love for the things of the world. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">3</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">More Severe Judgment.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: If a person does not practice what he preaches, he will be judged more severely, since his teaching has borne no fruit. For such a person is condemned along with the one who has sinned with his tongue. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">4</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Underlying Text.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: James indicates that judgment which was pronounced long ago [in Psalm 50:16&ndash;17]. On the Tabernacle and Its Vessels 3.1.95.</span><span class="c0 c4">5</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overeagerness to Teach.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: In the days of the apostles there were many who were eager to go out preaching the Word of God but who lacked proper instruction. One of them was Apollos, who preached Christ perfectly well but who for some reason knew only the baptism of John. But because he was a wise person, it was not long before a teacher appeared and led him into greater truth, which he readily accepted and thus became even better at his preaching task. There were others who were much less skilled who went to Antioch from Judea and told people there that they had to be circumcised according to the law of Moses if they wanted to be saved, a message which gave orthodox preachers no little trouble. It is this second kind of teacher that James wants to remove from office, so that they will not be a hindrance to those who are trying to preach the gospel in the right way. For just as someone who serves well obtains a good report, so someone who tries to usurp the right to teach when he is not prepared to do so deserves greater punishment than the one he would have received if he had kept his wickedness to himself.

For it is better to be guided by worthy speech, which is able to know and to express the fullness of all praise. For the most useful talent is to be able to speak wisdom when talking about how to live well. Foolish talk should be foreign to the saints.

Nevertheless, there are different kinds of sins, and James singles out one area of our lives where perfection is attainable, namely, control of the tongue. We may be imperfect, but we can still learn to avoid deception, abuse, cursing, pride, boasting, envy, quarreling, lying, perjury and so on.

Commentary on the Sermon on the Mount 55.2.</span><span class="c0 c4">16</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Putting Brakes on the Mouth.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: In other words, says James, how much more appropriate is it to put a brake in our own mouths so that we say only what agrees with the teachings of our Creator, and by controlling our tongues guide our doings in the right way also? Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">17</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">3:4 </span><span class="c1 c3">The Great Ship's Small Rudder</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Great Ships, Strong Winds, Small Rudder.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: These great ships stand for the minds of people in this life, whether they are good or bad. The strong winds which threaten them are the desires of these minds, by which they are naturally forced to act and which bring them either to a good or to a bad end. The rudder which directs them is the intention of the heart by which the elect cross the waves of this life and finally reach the harbor of their heavenly home. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">18</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Guiding the Tongue.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Andreas: James says that if we can contain the spirits of a horse by putting a bit into his mouth and control the direction of a ship with a small rudder, how much more ought we to be able to guide the tongue by right words toward doing good. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">19</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Analogies Work Together.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: This confirms what has been said about the tongue and adds something more to it, for the person who can domesticate an animal in so simple a manner will also master that which is more difficult to control. It is probable that James chose this example because somebody asked him why it was so difficult to contain something as small as the tongue. The text also implies that we should go on from merely controlling our tongues and find a higher use for them. For just as a domesticated horse is then used for better purposes, as is a ship under control, so our tongues ought to be used for saying the right thing at the right time.

Let no one deceive himself into thinking that he has never sinned, for if I have sinned, it is with my tongue. What more monstrous sin is there than blasphemy against God?

This fire is the exact opposite of that saving fire which is also like a tongue and which consumes all the dross and chaff of our vices, revealing the secrets of the heart.

We also read in Ammianus Marcellinus of a domesticated tigress which was sent to the emperor Anastasius from India. James emphasizes that that kind of thing is child's play compared with the art of taming the tongue, because the tongue is much wilder and more ferocious than any animal.

But I do not believe that this is the meaning. If James had wanted to say that, he would have done so, but instead he was determined to show what a great evil a man's tongue can be, so great that it cannot be tamed by anyone, even though that is not true of wild beasts. He said this not in order that we should tolerate this evil but in order that we should ask for divine grace to tame our tongue.

That is how heresy arose. But James forbids that kind of teaching and whatever comes from a wisdom which is not divine but diabolical.

True wisdom is a gift of God, and therefore it reflects his character. By your humble and wise actions show who you are (Bede). People who boast or who display signs of jealousy and selfishness do not have God's wisdom but a false imitation that comes from the world, the flesh and the devil. This false wisdom is a lie that leads to every kind of evil practice, and Christians must do their utmost to avoid it. God's wisdom has many important features, but it is most noticeable when it brings peace within and among believers. Bitterness and jealousy are demonically conceived (Cassiodorus) and taint everything they touch (Bede). As long as the soul seeks earthly glory, it is deprived of spiritual grace (Bede). As filth blinds, so does ambition (Chrysostom). Gracious wisdom, born of pure thoughts (Bede), comes from above, not from our power (Augustine). Having labored in this world, rejoice in the harvest of righteousness in the world to come (Origen). Those who desire peace sow the earth with the best seed and by their daily actions gain an increase that entitles them to inherit the fruits of righteousness in eternal life (Bede).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">3:13 </span><span class="c1 c3">The Meekness of Wisdom</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By Your Good Life Show Your Works.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Just as James has imposed silence on unworthy teachers and on those who want to obtain a teaching post without having the right qualifications of right living and circumspect behavior, so he also exhorts those who are wise and self-disciplined, or who at least think they are such, to demonstrate that fact by living out what they profess more than by trying to teach others. For someone who lives in a humble and wise way will give more evidence of his standing before God than any number of words could ever do.

For the fruit of righteousness is eternal life, which is the reward for good works, so that those who desire peace and implement it sow the earth with the best seed there is, and by their daily actions gain an increase which entitles them to inherit the fruits of life in heaven. The reprobate also reap what they sow, because they will also receive their just reward at the judgment. But that reward will not be the fruits of eternal life, but corruption, because they will reap the eternal punishment due to the corruption in which they passed their lives on earth.

When someone desires something inordinately, it tends to ensure the receiving of the opposite (Oecumenius). God will see to it that petitions arising from bad motives will not be fulfilled (Augustine, Andreas). So pray for right motives (Bede). The godly petitioner asks only for what is compatible with the divine promises (Didymus), for what pleases God and for what God will freely give (Pseudo-Dionysius). There can be no enduring coexistence of virtue with evil (Origen, Didymus), and so it has been since the fallen angels and Adam (Hilary of Arles). Our enmities tend to make us morally blind (Oecumenius, Symeon). So make the proper use of wisdom (Oecumenius).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">God yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us. This is so whether it refers to God's Spirit or the spirit in us that draws us toward God (Severian, Bede). Beware of self-conceit (Jerome, Augustine). Draw near to gracious people (Clement of Rome). God wants to dwell in you (Caesarius of Arles), but this indwelling can occur only in a humble, merciful heart (Macarius of Egypt, Valerian). God resists the proud who trust in their own strength but gives grace to the humble because they recognize their need and ask him for help (Didymus, Hesychius, Bede, Oecumenius). God dwells in us (Ambrose) that he might destroy the death that has come upon us and give us more grace (Andreas).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile we must fight against demonic captivity (Caesarius of Arles), a struggle in which one cannot be double-minded (Oecumenius). Those who remain unashamed of their sin are miserable, not so much because they have fallen from grace but because they have remained in their fallen state (Chrysostom). Mourn your sins (Leander). Be ready to repent while there is time (Bede). The most important blessings that we can ever receive are spiritual ones, and Christians must be sufficiently detached from the cares of this world that they can recognize this and pray for that kind of blessing. There is no room here for compromise. To embrace the world is to reject God. By </span><span class="c0 c3">world</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;James means the desires of ungodly people, who are at war with the Spirit of God. The only way to deal with this effectively is to humble ourselves and turn back to God in prayer and supplication. If we do this, we shall be full of contrition, and our prayers will be punctured by weeping rather than by laughter. Only if we come to God as abject penitents will he be willing to help us, but when we have that attitude, then we shall discover that far from rejecting us, he lifts us up and receives us with great joy and gladness into his heavenly kingdom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:1a </span><span class="c1 c3">The Cause of Infighting</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Excessive Comparison.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Dionysius: When a man has bought a large enough field and sees that his neighbor's is larger still, he wants to increase his own so as to make his house greater. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">1</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Test of Teaching.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Andreas: James shows that the teaching</span><span class="c0 c4">2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is not working, for they are all carnal and doing the most wicked things. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">3</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:1b </span><span class="c1 c3">Your Passions at War</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Struggle Within.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Your passions are at war in your members whenever your hands or your tongue or some combination of your bodily parts obeys the promptings of your depraved mind. It is also possible that the passions mentioned here are in fact good desires, pointing towards the riches and benefits of God's kingdom. On account of these and many other such things there is often a struggle between good and evil going on in our minds. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">4</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:2 </span><span class="c1 c3">You Do Not Have Because You Do Not Ask</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ask for Right Motives.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: The reason that you struggle but fail to obtain what you want is that you do not ask God to give these things to you. For if you ask him with the right motives, he will give you not only everything you need here on earth but also what you need to get to heaven. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">5</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Opposite Obtained from Wrong Desires.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: James proceeds here by way of thesis and antithesis. The thesis, that is, what they desire, is absurd to begin with, but the way they go about getting what they want ensures the exact opposite. Murder and fighting are not good things, but neither do the good things which they desire follow from them. Note also that here James speaks of murder and of fighting as spiritual things, not physical ones. It would be bad enough to think this kind of thing about robbers, but how much worse it is when we are dealing with people who have a certain amount of faith and who have turned to God. These are people who are trying to kill the soul and to fight against godliness. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">6</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:3 </span><span class="c1 c3">You Ask but Do Not Receive</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ask in the Right Spirit.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Didymus the Blind: The Savior said: &ldquo;Ask and you will receive. Everyone who asks will receive.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">7</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;How can it be then that some people pray but do not get what they ask for? To this it must be answered that if someone comes to prayer in the right way, omitting none of the prerequisites for intercession, he will receive everything he asks for. But if someone appears to be going beyond the permissible bounds laid down for intercession, he will appear to be asking for something in the wrong way and therefore will not obtain it. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">8</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Abusive Intentions.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Augustine: If someone intends to misuse what he receives, he will not receive it. Instead, God will pity him. Tractates 73.1.</span><span class="c0 c4">9</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">God Grasps Our Worthiness to Receive.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Andreas: It appears that some ask but do not receive. God ignores those who attack him and those who ask wrongly, according to their own desires. But someone will say that even those who ask for divine wisdom and virtue do not receive them. In reply it must be said that such people may be worthy to receive these good things, but they must do so in the right way. Perhaps they want such things merely for the pleasure of having them, and if so, they will not get them. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">10</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Asking for What Pleases God.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Pseudo-Dionysius: The hierarch,</span><span class="c0 c4">11</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;being a man of God, asks only for what is compatible with the divine promises, for what pleases God and for what God will freely give. He thereby demonstrates to God the lover of good that his own conduct is always modeled on the Good and shows those who are present what kinds of gifts the saints will receive. On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy 7.3.7.</span><span class="c0 c4">12</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">False Petitions.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Those who continue in their sins ask wrongly. They entreat the Lord ill-advisedly to forgive them sins which they are not prepared to forgive in others. Homilies on the Gospels 2.14.</span><span class="c0 c4">13</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:4 </span><span class="c1 c3">Friendship with the World Is Enmity with God</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Virtue and Evil.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Origen: Since evil forms a friendship with the world and virtue a friendship with God, virtue and evil cannot coexist. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">14</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">God and Mammon Opposites.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Didymus the Blind: Whoever loves the world by committing sin is revealed as an enemy of God, just as, on the other hand, one who affirms friendship with God by not sinning is a constant enemy of the world. Therefore, just as it is impossible to serve both God and mammon,</span><span class="c0 c4">15</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;so it is also impossible to be a friend of the world and of God at the same time. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">16</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even the Son Faced These Enmities.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Augustine: It was because of these enmities toward God that not even his only-begotten Son was spared. Tractates 101.2.</span><span class="c0 c4">17</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Undoing of the Fallen Angels.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hilary of Arles: Love of honor and pride and boastfulness is hostile to God, for these things were the undoing of the fallen angels as well as of the first human couple, which is why to this day they are described as &ldquo;enemies of God.&rdquo; Introductory Tractate on the Letter of James.</span><span class="c0 c4">18</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tolerating Adulterous Teachers.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: James calls these people adulterers, not because they practiced physical adultery but because they corrupted the commands which were instituted by God and turned away to other loves. They were even prepared to tolerate an adulterous teacher, even if it was clear that he was as deep in the mud as any pig. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">19</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Enmity Tends Toward Blindness.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Symeon the New Theologian: When one is at enmity toward someone else, he has no idea how to explain to others what that person approves of or likes, nor is he able to instruct them concerning his desires. Discourses 2.11.</span><span class="c0 c4">20</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:5 </span><span class="c1 c3">The Spirit He Has Made to Dwell in Us</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Spirit Draws Us Toward God.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Severian of Gabala: What this means is that the Spirit in us tends toward fellowship with God. He turns us away from the love of the world and gives us ever more grace. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">21</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whether This Is the Human Spirit.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Some think that this refers to God's Spirit, which does battle inside us against envy and tries to rid us of it. Others, however, think that it refers to the human spirit and is a warning to us not to desire or to attach ourselves to the lusts of this world, because as long as the spirit of our mind desires earthly things it does so with envy, because it envies the fact that others have what it wants to obtain. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">22</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Use Wisdom Rightly.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: James is here using an abbreviated form of speech in order to convey his meaning. What he is saying is this: &ldquo;I have thus far been warning you in my own words to make the right and proper use of your wisdom that you might not abuse it in your pride by corrupting it or misinterpreting it by your overly clever preaching.&rdquo; Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">23</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:6 </span><span class="c1 c3">God Opposes the Proud but Gives Grace to the Humble</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Draw Near to Gracious People.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Clement of Rome: Scripture says that God resists the arrogant but gives grace to the humble. We should associate with those to whom God's grace has been given. Letter to the Corinthians 1.30.2&ndash;3.</span><span class="c0 c4">24</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Against Those Who Demean Marriage.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Clement of Alexandria: There are those who say openly that marriage is fornication. They lay it down as a dogma that it was instituted by the devil. They are arrogant and claim that they are emulating the Lord, who did not marry and had no worldly possessions. It is their boast that they have a deeper understanding of the gospel than anyone else. To them Scripture says that God is against the proud and gives grace to the humble. Stromateis 3.49.1&ndash;2.</span><span class="c0 c4">25</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Warning Against Self-Conceit.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Augustine: Give me someone professing perpetual continence, who is free from all vices and blemishes of conduct. For her I fear pride&mdash;I dread the swelling of self-conceit from so great a blessing. The more there is in her which she is satisfied with, the more I fear that in pleasing herself she will displease the one who resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. Holy Virginity 34.</span><span class="c0 c4">26</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arrogance.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Jerome: One who holds his head high in arrogance hates God. Sermons 15.</span><span class="c0 c4">27</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The True Sign of a Christian.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Macarius of Egypt: The true sign of a Christian is the following: to feed the hungry and give drink to the thirsty, to endure hunger and thirst, to be poor in spirit, humble and contemptible in one's own eyes. First Syriac Epistle 2.</span><span class="c0 c4">28</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">God Wants to Dwell in You.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Caesarius of Arles: Be humble, in order that God may rest in you, which he wants to do. Sermons 210.5.</span><span class="c0 c4">29</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pride and Humility.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Valerian of Cimiez: One man is invited to grace in proportion to his love of humility. Another is consigned to punishment in proportion to his sin of pride. So if the swelling of pride is taking place in anyone, let him combat it, lest he draw the arms of heavenly justice against himself. Sermons 14.2.</span><span class="c0 c4">30</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Proud Trust Their Own Strength.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: God punishes robbers, perjurers, gluttons and other sinners because they are in contempt of his commandments, but it is said that he resists the proud in a special way. This is because those who trust in their own strength, who neglect to submit themselves to God's power, who really think that they can almost save themselves and therefore have no time to seek help from above&mdash;these are all deserving of greater punishment. On the other hand, God gives grace to the humble because they recognize their need and ask him for help to overcome the plague of their sins, and for this reason they deserve to be healed. It ought to be noted that James quotes this verse from Proverbs according to the Septuagint, as does Peter in his letter. The Latin text, which is based on the Hebrew original, reads: &ldquo;Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he shows favor.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">31</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">32</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Enmity with God.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: It is not absurd to say that contempt for divine doctrine and an inordinate love for the world derive from pride and are the substance of enmity against God. God resists the proud, because it is normal to resist one's enemies, and the proud must be counted among them. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">33</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:7 </span><span class="c1 c3">Submit to God and Resist the Devil</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Giving More Grace.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Andreas: If death came into the world by the malice of the devil, and Christ dwells in the inner man according to the Scriptures, this is the reason why he dwells in us, that he might destroy the death which has come upon us through the devil's cunning. And not only this, but that he might give us more grace as well. For he said: &ldquo;I have come that they might have life, and have it more abundantly.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">34</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">35</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fight Against Captivity.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Caesarius of Arles: Let us fight as hard as we can, with the Lord's help, against that most harsh captivity of the soul [which is the devil's ability to divert our thoughts away from spiritual concerns].

The Prayer of Job and David 3.11.29.</span><span class="c0 c4">37</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nearness to God.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Draw near to God in humility, by walking in his footsteps, and he will draw near to you in his mercy, setting you free from all anxiety. For nobody is far away from God in terms of physical distance; the problem is one of attitudes and emotions. For the person who is anxious to do what is right is always near to God, whereas the one who is lost in his wickedness is far away from him, regardless of where either one happens to live.

It is clear from what Job says that the mind here stands for our very life: &ldquo;skin for skin,&rdquo; [Satan says], &ldquo;all that a man has he will give for his own soul.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">39</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">40</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:9 </span><span class="c1 c3">Mourn and Weep</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First, Confess.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Chrysostom: The person who repents after sinning is worthy of blessings, not of mourning, as he returns to the company of the righteous. First, confess your sins that you may be justified, for if someone is not ashamed of his sin he is miserable, not so much because he fell from grace but because he has remained in his fallen state. And if it is a wicked thing not to repent after sinning, what punishment will someone deserve who sins as a matter of course? If a person overcome with the need to repent is unclean, what forgiveness will there be for someone who suffers because he remains in his sins?

To the extent that humility can oppose it, it is a great good. And when both of these are consciously and deliberately at work, good I mean and evil, everyone who humbles himself before God and rejects the proud will be raised up, and his humility will take him to the heights.</span><span class="c0 c4">46</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">47</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Humble Are Blessed.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hesychius: It is a blessed thing to humble oneself before the Lord. For James says: &ldquo;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.&rdquo; Whenever we are thus humbled, even if we are tempted by demons and even if we are attacked by those who hate virtue, we have God to deliver us, as long as we do not forget his law or curse him in our sufferings. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">48</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">4:11&ndash;17 PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN LIVING</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Humble persons understand that they are in no position to pass judgment on others, and they will not do so. On the contrary, they recognize that they are also under judgment and will be more concerned to put their own lives right than to go about criticizing others. Christians must also watch how they plan their lives. It is all too easy to map out a future in which God has no place, but we must remember that everything we do is bound by the limits of time and of his will. To forget this is to fall back into the sin of pride, which can only lead to our destruction. Many would prefer to mind the business of others more than their own (Cyril of Alexandria). Such pride ultimately arises from contempt of others (Oecumenius). Our knowing complicates our sinning (Augustine). The faith rightly proclaimed must first be lived (Oecumenius). There is only one law and one lawgiver (Hilary of Arles, Bede, Theophylact). View your life in terms of the wider perspective of God's grace (Cyril of Alexandria, Oecumenius). James is aware of how fleeting and empty our present life is (Augustine, Oecumenius). Grace enables good effort (Chrysostom).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">4:11 </span><span class="c1 c3">Do Not Speak Evil</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wicked Acts Give Birth to Arrogance.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Cyril of Alexandria: Every wicked act dulls the sense of our thoughts and gives birth to arrogance. For although it is necessary for each one to examine himself and behave according to God's will, many people do not do this but prefer to mind the business of others. If they happen to see others suffering, it seems that they forget their own weaknesses and set about criticizing them and slandering them. They condemn them, not knowing that they suffer from the same things as the people they have criticized, and in so doing they condemn themselves. The wise Paul writes exactly the same thing: &ldquo;If you judge another in something, you condemn yourself, for the one who judges does the same things.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">1</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">2</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pride Arises from Contempt.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: James knows that haughtiness and pride arise from contempt and disdain toward the meek, which pushes those who behave that way to despise them completely.

Therefore it should not be considered of great importance, because it is temporal, not eternal. Sermons 124.1.</span><span class="c0 c4">9</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our Temporal Labor Vanishes.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: James says this in order to indicate just how fleeting and empty our present life is.

People with a lot of money should consider what it is that they have&mdash;a wasting resource that they cannot take with them when they die and that even now is in a state of constant decay. The love of money is the root of all evil and will lead people to defraud and even kill those who are less fortunate than they are. The rich must repent while there is still time (Hilary of Arles), casting their bread upon waters (Oecumenius). God's love is delaying judgment to give them time for repentance (Hesychius). Perishable riches (Bede) can neither hurt a good person or help a bad person (Caesarius of Arles). Luxury comes to nothing (Chrysostom). God's power ultimately puts to right all human injustices (Hilary of Arles, Bede, Theophylact). Pray for a soul set free from excess (Chrysostom). It is time to give generously where we have given only sparingly (Caesarius of Arles). Human injustices are viewed in the light of the injustice done to the righteous Man, Christ (Theophylact).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">5:1 </span><span class="c1 c3">You Rich, Weep and Howl</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Judgment Delayed.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hesychius: God delays the judgment because of his love for humanity, so that those who repent may not suffer along with those who are condemned.

For the person who gives his wealth to the poor does not lose it but keeps every penny. This is why the Preacher said: &ldquo;Cast your bread upon the waters,&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that is, upon the apparent corruption and decadence of this world, and it will not be lost, but rather it will preserve us from destruction.

How long will luxury last? How long will there be licentiousness? Have not the heedless among us been warned? What about the mockers and the procrastinators?

Has luxury been condemned? It certainly has&mdash;so why do you continue to strive for it? A man has made bread, but the excess has been trimmed away. A man has made wine, but the excess has been cut off there also. God desires that we should pray not for impure food but for souls set free from excess. For everything that God has created is good, and nothing which has been received with thanks is to be despised.

Those of us who have been careless up to now can, with God's help, correct ourselves, provide that we are willing to dispense more generously those alms which we have given sparingly up to now.

Nevertheless it also includes others who suffered at the hands of the Jews, and he may even have been speaking prophetically about his own approaching death. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">16</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">5:7&ndash;11 THE LORD'S IMMINENT RETURN</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The return of Christ was a constant hope in the early church, where there was a strong conviction that they were living in the last days before the end. To those who were suffering, the wait seemed interminable, but it was important to develop a proper sense of perspective. The example of the patience of Job and the Old Testament prophets was held out to Christians as proof that what they were hoping for would eventually come and that when it finally arrived the wait would seem like no time at all. Although God now waits for our repentance (Cyril of Alexandria), he may come quickly at any time to dispense justice (Bede). As in the case of Job, the devil is allowed to put us on trial, not merely in order to take our possessions away but that when that happens he can force us to curse God because of it (Chrysostom). Our hope is for eternal, not temporal, rewards (Augustine, Bede).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">5:7 </span><span class="c1 c3">Wait Patiently for the Lord to Come</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">God Waits for Repentance.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Cyril of Alexandria: If God delays the punishment of sinners, waiting for them to repent, it is not because his character has changed, so that now he loves sin. Rather he is giving them time to repent.

They did not complain at such an end but were willing to endure it. Others put up with long labors without complaining, for example, Noah, who spent a hundred years building his ark, and Moses, who took forty years to lead his people out of slavery and into the promised land.

But there is such a thing as giving thanks out of fear, and also such a thing as giving thanks in grief. This is what Job did when, in great suffering, he thanked God, saying: &ldquo;The Lord has given, the Lord has taken away.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">6</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Let no one say that he was not grieving over what had happened to him or that he did not feel it deeply. Do not take away the great praise due to the righteous.&hellip; How great is this praise? Tell me, in what circumstances do you bless Job? Is it when he had all those camels and flocks and herds? Or is it when he says: &ldquo;The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away&rdquo;? For the devil also harms us not in order to take our possessions away so that we have nothing left but so that when that happens he can force us to curse God because of it. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">7</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hope for Eternal Rewards.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Augustine: James means: &ldquo;Bear your temporal misfortunes as Job did, but do not hope for temporal goods as a reward for your patience, such as were returned to him double. Rather hope for the eternal goods which the Lord went before us to secure.&rdquo; Letters 140.10.</span><span class="c0 c4">8</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Crown after Death.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: God shows his compassion toward us by setting us free from our temptations in this life and by glorifying the living before others because of the constancy of their faith. After their deaths he crowns them in secret, so that the memory which they deserve will not be taken away from them by other people. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">9</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">5:12&ndash;20 SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;James closes his letter with a brief sketch of how we should conduct our relationship with God. First of all, it is important to avoid demeaning God's name, which points to his power and presence in the world. Let the witness of your life be stronger than any oath (Cyril of Alexandria). An oath adds nothing to a simple yes or no (Chrysostom) and tends toward disaster as seen in the case of Herod (Bede). We must not give the creation more value than it has by deifying it (Cyril of Alexandria). The need of an oath comes from an unsure conscience (Leander). Pray and praise God whether in good times or bad (Andreas, Bede).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In time of suffering and illness we must turn to God, and if our sins are too great for us to deal with on our own, we must call the elders of the church to come and assist us. The apostolic tradition calls for the elders to anoint the sick with the oil of mercy and pray for their healing (Hilary of Arles, Bede, Oecumenius). The prayer of faith is efficacious (Caesarius of Arles) when it gives expression to the petition of the whole consenting church (Hilary of Arles). Do not leave sin unconfessed and ignored either in your own house or another's (Augustine). And do not bore others with every detail (Braulio of Saragossa). The Lord himself who had no sin sets the example for sinners to pray for our sins (Augustine). Prayers of the righteous are beneficial (Pseudo-Dionysius), especially when one does works fitting to the prayer (Maximus the Confessor). God loves to be asked (Bede). The effectiveness of prayer offered by the right people in the right way can never be underestimated, as the case of Elijah reminds us. We are called to persevere in prayer like Elijah (Hilary of Arles), who was on fire with zeal for God (Chrysostom, Theodoret).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The most important thing of all is to recover the lost sheep who have gone astray, and those who do this will give incontrovertible proof of the fact that they are ready to reign with Christ in his eternal kingdom. One who converts others will save his own soul (Origen, Hilary of Arles). Out of love (Bede) the shepherd of souls rescues and delivers souls from death (Gregory the Great, Symeon). Unless we protect what has been sown in us by constant care, the devil will snatch it away (Chrysostom).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">5:12a </span><span class="c1 c3">Do Not Swear</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">An Oath Adds Nothing.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Chrysostom: What if someone swears an oath and claims that he was forced to do so? The fear of God is more powerful than any force. For though you may start out by swearing all kinds of promises, you will not keep any of them. Moreover, you would not dare to swear or give an oath in matters of human law, which you accept whether you want to or not. You would certainly never claim that you were forced into doing so. Now the person who has heard the blessings of God and who has prepared himself as Christ has commanded will never claim any need to do anything of the kind, for he is respected and honored by all. What is needed beyond a simple yes and no? An oath adds nothing to these, for no one has to be told that evil is the source of both excess and its deficient opposite. An oath is a form of excess. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">1</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Do Not Deify Creation.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Cyril of Alexandria: Let the witness of our life be stronger than an oath, and if some shameless person dares to ask an oath from you, let your yes be yes and your no be no, instead of swearing an oath. James forbids us to swear by heaven or by earth for this reason, that we should not give the creation more value than it has by deifying it. For those who swear, swear by something greater than themselves, as the apostle says.</span><span class="c0 c4">2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">3</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Herod's Oath Recalled.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: This is the judgment to which Herod fell victim, so that he found that he had either to break his oath or commit another shameful act in order to avoid breaking it. Homilies on the Gospels 2.23.</span><span class="c0 c4">4</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">5:12b </span><span class="c1 c3">Let Your Yes Be Yes</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Unsure Conscience.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Leander: Jesus said: &ldquo;Let your yes be yes and your no, no.&rdquo; Any more than this is evil. So do not swear for good reason, because that is evil. It is said to be evil because the need of an oath comes from an unsure conscience. It is necessary to extract an oath from one whose sincerity is in doubt, but why should you bind yourself by an involuntary oath when you are bound to show with your lips the sincerity of your heart? Speak the truth from your heart and you will not need an oath.

Call on God. And what should you do when you are happy? Praise him. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">6</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pray for Grace.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Just as James forbade people to complain to each other about their sufferings, so now he goes on to say how they should behave. If someone has suffered an injury, he ought to go to the church and pray that God will send him the grace of his comfort, so that the sadness of this world, which leads to death, will not overtake him. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">7</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">5:14 </span><span class="c1 c3">The Anointing of the Sick by Elders</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Oil of Mercy.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hilary of Arles: This sickness is the sickness of sin. If someone is struck down by his own thoughts, then he should pray on his own, but if he has committed some sin he should ask for the church's prayers. The custom mentioned here is followed even today, for the grace of mercy is symbolized by oil. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of James.</span><span class="c0 c4">8</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pray for the Sick.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Just as he has already advised the person who has been injured, so now James gives his advice to the one who is ill. In order to prevent the foolishness of complaining, he told the injured person to pray and sing, and now he tells the person who is sick, either in body or in faith, to call the elders in proportion to the gravity of the illness which he is enduring. James does not advise this person to call the younger members of the church because they are less experienced in such matters and run the risk of saying or doing something which will make matters worse. We read in the New Testament that the apostles did this sort of thing, and the custom is retained in the church, that the priests will anoint a person who is ill and pray for his healing. And this is not the prerogative of the priests only, for in cases of necessity any Christian may do this, provided that he uses only oil which has been consecrated by the bishop. And of course anyone who anoints a sick person in this way must invoke the name of God over him while doing so. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">9</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">An Apostolic Practice.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: The apostles did this even during the time when our Lord was still on earth.

Let him receive the body and blood of Christ, be anointed by the presbyters with consecrated oil and ask them and the deacons to pray over him in Christ's name. If he does this, he will receive not only bodily health but also the forgiveness of his sins.

For if we are called to a friend's house and find him about to punish someone over whom he has power, it is considered most inhumane for us not to intervene. Letters 153.</span><span class="c0 c4">15</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Confess and Believe.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: We must use our common sense in applying this commandment. As far as small, everyday sins are concerned, we ought to admit them to one another and believe that we are saved from them by praying for each other. But if we have sinned in a more serious way, then we ought to follow the principle of showing our leprosy to the priest and do penance for it as much and for as long as he thinks is right. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">16</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Boring and Detailed Confession Not Needed.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Braulio of Saragossa: Since it would be a long and unpleasant task to reveal my sinful ways to you and to tell you everything in detail, it must suffice for me to reveal to your most holy mind that I am not what you believe, though I beg you to pray to God that he might make me what you believe.

For if he who neither has, nor had, nor will have any sin prays for our sins, how much more ought we to pray for each other's sins! And if he for whom we have nothing to forgive forgives us, how much more should we forgive one another, knowing that we cannot live on earth without sinning! Tractates 58.2.</span><span class="c0 c4">18</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Prayers of the Righteous.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Pseudo-Dionysius: Scriptural truth has passed on to us the fact that the prayers of the righteous are of use only to those who are worthy of them, and only in this life, not after death. On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy 7.3.6.</span><span class="c0 c4">19</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Doing Works Fitting to the Prayer.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Maximus the Confessor: There are two ways in which the prayer of a righteous man is effective. The first is when the person praying does so by offering to God his works done according to his commands. Then the prayer is not just a matter of words, blurted out meaninglessly with the empty echo of the tongue, but powerful and living and inspired with the spirit of the commandments. For the true basis of prayer and supplication is the fulfillment of the commandments by virtue. This makes the prayer of a righteous person strong and full of power. The second way is when the person who asks for the prayers of a righteous man fulfills the works of prayer, above all by putting his life right. Then he makes the prayer of the righteous man strong, because it is reinforced by his own wonderful conversion. For there is nothing to be profited by a person who makes use of the prayer of a righteous man if he is himself already more inclined to virtue than to vice. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">20</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ask God.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: God loves to be asked, so that he can give.

But just in case you think that you could never measure up to someone as holy as Elijah, James adds that he was a man, just as we are, even if he was second to none in his virtue.

The three years and six months represent the time of the antichrist, but the three years may also stand for the three ages of human history from the creation to the time of David, or they may symbolize the patriarchs, the prophets and the apostles. The miracle mentioned here is meant to encourage believers to persevere in their struggle against the unrighteous, for as in the case of Elijah, even if only one person prays, his prayer represents the common mind of all the righteous.

Suddenly the elements were transformed, as the prophet's word fell like a fiery bolt on the hollow parts of the earth, and immediately everything dried up, became a desert and disappeared. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">25</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On Fire with Zeal for God.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Theodoret of Cyr: It is rash to think that anything which spiritual men say is excessive or badly stated, for what is said is not mindless or superficial. For this man was a prophet, and the greatest of the prophets, on fire with zeal for God. What he said, he said by the inspiration of God's Spirit, which explains its extraordinary character.

It is like the seeds sown by farmers. They are sown once, but they do not survive forever unless they are carefully nurtured. And unless the tillers of the soil protect the seeds, they will be exposed to the birds and to every seed-eating creature. We are just like this, unless we protect what has been sown in us by constant care, for the devil will snatch it away and our own lethargy will destroy it. The sun dries it up, the rain drowns it, and weeds choke it, so that it is not enough for the sower to pass by once only. Rather he must tend it often, driving away the birds of the air, pulling up the weeds and filling up the rocky places with much soil. He must prevent, block off and eject any form of destruction. Where soil is concerned, everything depends on the farmer, for without him it remains lifeless, ready only to suffer harm. It is not like that with spiritual soil however. For in spiritual matters it is not all up to the teachers; at least half the effort must come from the pupils. It is up to us the teachers to sow the seed but up to you the pupils to do the rest.

Lessons in Job 19.31.</span><span class="c0 c4">32</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Preach in Order to Convert.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hilary of Arles: Someone who preaches to sinners in order to convert them will save his soul, even if the people he preaches to are not actually converted. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of James.</span><span class="c0 c4">33</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Motive of Love.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: James does all he can here to ensure that imperfect people like ourselves do not gloat over winning others away from their wicked ways and converting them to the truth by reminding us that we should be engaged in such work out of love for our brothers and sisters.
